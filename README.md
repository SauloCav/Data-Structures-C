<strong>Some Data Structures developed in C</strong>

<strong>Stack:</strong></br>
A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure. A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate to the top of the stack. If you want to reach a plate that is not on the top of the stack, you need to remove all of the plates that are above that one. In the same way, in a stack data structure, you can only access the element on the top of the stack. The element that was added last will be the one to be removed first. Therefore, to implement a stack, you need to maintain a pointer to the top of the stack (the last element to be added).
